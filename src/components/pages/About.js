      <p>
        As a beginner web developer, I am excited to begin my journey in the
        development field where I hope to apply some of my previous experience
        as a Business Analyst. I am currently enrolled in the Rutgers coding
        bootcamp, where I have been learning HTML, CSS, and other web
        development tools. I have been applying these skills in class
        mini-projects and weekly challenges. I am a quick learner and highly
        motivated, and I am looking forward to learning new skills as the
        Rutgers bootcamp continues.
