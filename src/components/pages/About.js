          As a beginner web developer, I am excited to begin my journey in the
          development field where I hope to apply some of my previous experience
          as a Business Analyst. I am currently enrolled in the Rutgers coding
          bootcamp, where I have been learning HTML, CSS, and other web
          development tools. I have been applying these skills in class
          mini-projects and weekly challenges. I am a quick learner and highly
          motivated, and I am looking forward to learning new skills as the
          Rutgers bootcamp continues.
